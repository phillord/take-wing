\label{cha:rapid-walk-through}

\section{A Taster}
\label{sec:taster}

We take a rapid walk-through an ontology to demonstrate the capabilities of
Tawny-OWL. As with all the examples in this book, the code in this chapter is
complete, therefore, we need to start with a preamble, defining a namespace
and performing some imports.

\begin{tawny}
(ns take.wing.walk-through
  (:refer-clojure :only [])
  (:use [tawny.owl]
        [tawny.english]
        [tawny.reasoner]))
\end{tawny}

As we discussed in Section~\ref{what_is_an_ontology}, the word ontology has
quite a few different meaning, but here we use it to mean a specific
computational object; so, before, we do anything else, we start a new empty
ontology, which we call |walk_through|; as it happens, we do not need to refer
to this object again because it is now set as the default for the rest of this
chapter. We also take the opportunity to set our choice of reasoner, in this
case HermiT. We will see later how we use this.

\begin{tawny}
(defontology walk_through
  :iri "http://purl.org/ontolink/walk_through")

(reasoner-factory :hermit)
\end{tawny}

Ontologies are all about classes, so we now define two classes one called
|Book| and one called |TakeWing| which is a subclass of |Book|~\footnote{One
  of the joys of ontology development is that the ontology development
  community is rich with arguments about the correct way to model things.
  Even, with relatively simple models it is easy to hit these arguments and,
  in fact, we have done so here already. There is a strong argument to say
  that \lstinline{TakeWing} is actually an instance of \lstinline{Book} rather
  than a subclass, because there is only one of them. Or, that
  \lstinline{TakeWing} is a class because there are many copies of \lstinline{TakeWing}.
  Or, that it's a metaclass, because sometimes it operates like a class and
  sometimes an individual. In this book, we try to touch on these arguments,
  but not get weighed down by them}. Anything that is true of |Book| must also
be true of |TakeWing|.

\begin{tawny}
(defclass Book)

(defclass TakeWing
  :super Book)
\end{tawny}

Of course, this does not tell us much about |TakeWing| as a book. There are
many properties of books, but one of the most informative is the subject of
the book. So, we define a new class of |Subject| and introduce a property
|about| which we use to relate books and subjects~\footnote{Strictly, an
  \emph{object property}, hence the ``o''. We describe these more fully
  later}.

\begin{tawny}
(defclass Subject)

(defoproperty about)
\end{tawny}

Now, we need some subject listings. Of course, there are many of these in
existence already, and Tawny-OWL is fully capable of reusing one of these;
however, for this simple example, it is not necessary, so we define a small
classification of our own. We describe |Bird| and |Ontology| as subclasses of
|Subject| and say that they are different (|:disjoint|) and do not overlap. We
also describe |TawnyOWL| as part of the |Ontology| subject.

\begin{tawny}
(as-subclasses
 Subject
 :disjoint
 (defclass Bird)
 (defclass Ontology))

(defclass TawnyOWL
  :super Ontology)
\end{tawny}

We can now make some basic queries against the statements that we have made to
make sure that they all make sense. So, for example, the |subclasses| function
lists all of the subclasses of |Book|, or we can use the predicate function
|subclass?|. On its own this functionality is enough to build a simple
hierarchy.

\begin{tawny}
(subclasses Book)
;; => #{#[Class 0x660b9d1 "TakeWing"@en]}
(subclass? Book TakeWing)
;;=> true
(subclass? Subject TawnyOWL)
;;=> true
\end{tawny}

However, the functionality of OWL allows much richer statements than this. We
can extend the existing definition of |TakeWing| and state that it is a book
that is about |TawnyOWL| and only about |TawnyOWL|.

\begin{tawny}
(class
 TakeWing
 :super
 (some-only about TawnyOWL))
\end{tawny}

Now, we can build some \emph{defined} classes. We describe an |OntologyBook|
as a |Book| which is about |Ontology|.

\begin{tawny}
(defclass
 OntologyBook
 :equivalent
 (and Book
      (some about Ontology)))
\end{tawny}

There are two critical points about this definition. The first is that we had
said nothing at all about the relationship between this class and |TakeWing|.
We can confirm this by asking about the |subclasses| of |OntologyBook|, and
showing that our ontology knows of no ontology books.

\begin{tawny}
(subclasses OntologyBook)
;;=> #{}
\end{tawny}

However, this is not quite true. The second critical part of the definition,
the use of |:equivalent|. This allows us to use \emph{reasoning} to infer
other subclasses. For this we use the |isubclasses| method instead and find
that |TakeWing| can be infered to be an |OntologyBook|.

\begin{tawny}
(isubclasses OntologyBook)
;; => #{#[Class 0x557ef049 "TakeWing"@en]}
\end{tawny}

We can infer that |TakeWing| is a subclass of |OntologyBook| because we have
said that an ontology book is one about ontologies and that this book is about
Tawny-OWL which is sub-topic of ontologies. Even in this simple example, we
need to put together a number of facts to draw this conclusion.

In this case, though, there is some apparent similarity between the definition
of |OntologyBook| and |TakeWing| -- both of them are look relatively similar,
at least once we substitute |Ontology| for |TawnyOWL| in the definition of
|TakeWing|. Our computational reasoner, however, does not work in this way,
and can draw conclusions even when this similarity does not exist. Consider
this example where we describe books which are not about birds.

\begin{tawny}
(defclass NonBirdBook
  :equivalent
  (and Book
       (not (some about Bird))))

(subclasses NonBirdBook)
;;=> #{}

(isubclasses NonBirdBook)
;; => #{#[Class 0x557ef049 "TakeWing"@en]}
\end{tawny}

Here too, we can classify |TakeWing|. The chain of logic in this case is that
|TakeWing| is about |Ontology|, that |Ontology| is different from |Bird|, and
that, therefore, |TakeWing| is not about |Bird| which makes it a |NonBirdBook|.

This ability to infer new knowledge is the meat and drink of computational
ontologies. They allow a rich description of the environment with a tightly
defined semantics which makes that environment comptutationally accessible.
Here, we have only touched on the expressivity of OWL -- there are many
constructs that we have not shown yet. We have also used this for only for a
small ontology, but as the ontologies grow larger, the value increases.

For existing ontology developers, this will familiar ground. Tawny-OWL,
however, brings something new to other mechanisms for developing ontologies;
that is a fully programmatic environment. As well as the ability to automate
any part of ontology development that we choose, this also brings a rich set
of highly-developed tools that programmers have been developing and using for
many years to develop software in a repeatable, scalable and
highly-collaborative way. It is this which we explore next.


\section{Environment}
\label{sec:environment}

Tawny-OWL takes a different approach to other ontology development
environments. It is not an application, it is just a programmatic
library\footnote{Sort of. In other environments, we have argued that Tawny-OWL
  is an textual application rather than a programmatic library. In reality, it
is a bit of both: it is a library which is designed with development rather
than manipulation of ontologies as its primary purpose. For the latter, we
would have done things rather differently.}. This has a
key advantage over a more traditional ontology editor; rather than providing
a complete environment, Tawny-OWL just recasts ontology development as a form
of software development and borrows its entire environment from software
development. This means we can reuse the software engineering environment; our
experience is that the richness and maturity of software development tools far
outweights any loss of specificity to ontology development.

Our hope is that for structurally simple ontologies, Tawny-OWL should be
usable by non-programmers, with a simple and straight-forward syntax. In this
section, we introduce the core technology and the basic environment that is
needed to make effective use of Tawny-OWL, as well as some optional extras.


\subsection{The OWL API}
\label{sec:owl-api}

Tawny-OWL is built using the \url{http://owlapi.sourceforge.net/[OWL} API].
This library is a comprehensive tool for generating, transforming and using
OWL Ontologies. It is widely used, and is the basis for the Protege 4
editor\cite{greycite2912}. Being based on this library, Tawny-OWL is reliable
and standard-compliant (or at least as reliable and standard-compliant as
Protege!). It is also easy to integrate directly with other tools written
using the OWL API, include Protege.

\subsection{Clojure}
\label{sec:clojure}

Tawny-OWL is a programmatic library build on top of the Clojure
language. Tawny-OWL takes many things from Clojure. These include:

\begin{itemize}
\item the basic syntax with parentheses and with \texttt{:keywords}
\item the ability to effectively add new syntax
\item the ability to extend Tawny-OWL with patterns
\item integration with other data sources
\item the test environment
\item the build, dependency and deployment tools
\end{itemize}

In addition, most of the tools and environment that Tawny-OWL use to
enable development were built for Clojure and are used directly with
little or no additions. These include:

\begin{itemize}
\item IDEs or editors used for writing Clojure
\item the leiningen build tool
\end{itemize}

Tawny-OWL inherits a line-orientated syntax which means that it works
well with tools written for any programming language; most notable
amoung these are version control systems which enable highly
collaborative working on ontologies.

Clojure is treated as a programmatic library -- the user never starts or
runs Clojure, and there is no \texttt{clojure} command. Rather confusingly,
this role is fulilled by Leiningen, which is the next item on the list.

\subsection{Leiningen}
\label{sec:leiningen}

\url{http://www.leiningen.org[Leiningen}] is a tool for working with Clojure
projects. Given a directory structure, and some source code leiningen
will perform many project tasks including checking, testing, releasing
and deploying the project. In addition to these, it has two critical
functions that every Tawny-OWL project will use: first, it manages
dependencies, which means it will download both Tawny-OWL and Clojure;
second, it starts a REPL which is the principle means by which the user
will directly or indirectly interact with Tawny-OWL.

\subsection{REPL}
\label{sec:repl}

Clojure provides a REPL -- Read-Eval-Print-Loop. This is the same things
as a shell, or command line. For instance, we can the following into a
Clojure REPL, and it will print the return value, or 2 in this case.


\begin{tawny}
;; returns 2
(+ 1 1)
\end{tawny}

The most usual way to start a REPL is to use leiningen, which then sets
up the appropriate libraries for the local project. For example,
\texttt{lein repl} in the source code for this document, loads a REPL with
Tawny-OWL pre-loaded.

In practice, most people use the REPL indirectly through their IDE.

\subsection{IDE or Editor}
\label{sec:ide-or-editor}

Clojure is supported by a wide variety of editors, which in turn means
that they can be used for Tawny-OWL. The choice of an editor is a very
personal one (I use Emacs), but in practice any good editor will work.

The editor has two main roles. Firstly, as the name suggests it provides
a rich environment for writing Tawny-OWL commands. Secondly, the IDE
will start and interact with a REPL for you. This allows you to add or
remove new classes and other entities to an ontology interactively.
Tawny-OWL has been designed to take advantage of an IDE environment; in
most cases, for example, auto-completion will happen for you.

\subsection{Testing}
\label{sec:testing}

Tawny-OWL can use any of the testing enviroments that come with Clojure,
including |clojure.test| which is the most basic environment provided with
Clojure. This integrates well with both leiningen or an IDE both of which will
run tests for you and report on test cases.

\subsection{Version Control and Collaboration}
\label{sec:vers-contr-coll}

Most ontologies are developed by many people, so some form of collaboration
support is needed. In general, with Tawny-OWL we achieve this in the same way
that programmers do; rather than providing a collaborative environment where
multiple people can edit the environment at the same time, we use version
control where different developers use slightly different versions of the
ontology, and then merge them together at the end. This works well with
Tawny-OWL as it has an attractive, line-orientated syntax. The various version
control tools can scale easily to thousands of developers which is well in
excess of most ontology projects. For this purpose, we use |git|.

\subsection{Continuous Integration}
\label{sec:cont-integr}

An ontology can be \emph{continuously integrated} with both other ontologies
that it depends on, and with the software environment which uses it. Unlike
other ontology continuous integration systems, Tawny-OWL is just a library --
so anything that works with Clojure (or more abstractly a Java Virtual
Machine) will also work with Tawny-OWL.

\section{Recap}
\label{sec:recap}

In this Chapter, we have built a small basic ontology which non-the-less shows
the computational power of OWL ontologies, while surveying the advantages that
Tawny-OWL brings as a development environment for ontologies.
