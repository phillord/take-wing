\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{cha:conclusions}

In this book, we have introduced Tawny-OWL as well as covering some of
the background for OWL and Ontology building in general. None of
these topics are simple ones and, of course, there is more to say
about both.

However, taken together these tools provide a powerful environment for
the describing the world around us in a computationally amenable
way. This can be used to structure, query and order knowledge about
the world. Perhaps it is presumptuous, but with luck these somewhat
prosaic capabilities to allow us to understand the world a little
better.
